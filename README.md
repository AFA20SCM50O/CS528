# CS528
Project for CS 528: Data Privacy and Security


The project will simulate a cryptographic encryption and decryption of various messages including different cryptographic functions such as MD5, SHA-1, AES, etc. The project will show how increased levels of security measures protect data, as well as the vulnerabilities of using only one security measure, or an attack by an adversary with background knowledge, plaintext, or previous decrypted messages. The project will also show the use of both same use keys as well as different keys for each message. The report will explain the vulnerabilities of such keys.

Data set and proposed application:
Anticipated building blocks (cryptographic schemes, anonymization, or randomization mechanisms:
MD5, SHA-1, AES 256,  Signatures, Private and Public Keys, Hashlib.
