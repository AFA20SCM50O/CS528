# CS528
Project for CS 528: Data Privacy and Security
1.	Team Description
The project design, implementation, testing, and documentation is brought forth by a solo Illinois Institute of Technology 3rd Semester Master of Computer Science student, Alexis Ortega. Alexis completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science at Northern Illinois University on track to attend Law School, but decided to instead make a career change toward Computer Science. He began his academic career at IIT in 2020, and although he has little background in Data Science, he has a curiosity and enthusiasm for Information Security. Alexis is projected to graduate from IIT this summer with specializations in Information Security and Assurance and Software Engineering.

2.	Motivation & Application
There exists a growing need for data protection and security as the world rapidly and inevitably moves toward being totally digital. Data and encryption and protection is used in most aspects of the digital world. It can be used to secure military communications where messages, images, and other files can be safely sent back and forth between allies with little worry that an adversary can acquire the sensitive information. More locally and perhaps more commonly it is also used to protect user information in databases such as account information, medical history, browser history, etc. 
Cryptographic Encryption can be used to Encrypt various forms of files from images, files, text, and video. To ensure the privacy and safety of such files there exists various ciphers that can be applied as well as some different protocols. A few will be displayed in this project

3.	Goal & Design
This project shows the encryption, decryption, and potential attacks  through various ciphers (Caesar's, AES, RSA, symmetric, and asymmetric cryptosystems) and file types (text input, text file, images, and large data files)

To build the project:

1. Download the files in the zip folder provided
2. Save to your machine
3. Create a Virtual Environment where you save the project files
4. Activate said Virtual Environment you created
5. Pip install pycrytodome
6. Run the Encrypt Files first, then the decrypt Files
7. If you run into issues with any of the programs you may need to change the paths for some of the files that are opened within the program
8. or you could simply clone the repository - https://github.com/AFA20SCM50O/CS528.git
